# My processs for CI (hypothetical)

This hypothetical team project will have been written in Python and will run on the Flask framework. For linting, we will use Black formatter and iSort. While Pylint seems like a good option, I've read it's too trigger happy sometimes and that can slow down production while possibly not adding much more reliability. For testing, we will use PyTest as it offers small tests that can be scaled up and build into our CI pipeline. The syntax is also very simple and almost similar to what I've experienced in the JS world with Jest. While self-hosted options, such as Jenkins, and cloud-options, such as Github Actions, exists, they're not the only competitors. From what I read in regards to PyTest, I see that it integrates nicely with CircleCI, another cloud-based service. It really depends on what you're going for. Github Actions tends to be a cheaper alternative to CircleCI. The latter offers better performance, is constantly releasing new testing features, and has better monitoring tools for deployment. They also offer self-hoste options.
